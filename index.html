          The New York State Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act
          requires covered businesses to provide early warnings of closures and
          layoffs to employees, representatives, the Department of Labor, and
          others. The goal is to give workers and their families time to
          transition and find new jobs or alternatives.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          According to the NYC WARN notices, the industry/business that has been
          most affected in New York State is the hospitality industry, which
          includes restaurants, resorts and bars. 708 hospitality businesses
          have shut down either permenantly or temporarily since COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Broadly speaking, the hospitality industry includes lodging, food and
          drink service, event planning, theme parks, and transportation.

          This bar chart shows the top five industries that have suffered the
          most since the state-mandated order to close businesses during the
          pandemic. The bar chart shows a disproportionate number of hospitality
          businesses that have shut down either temporarily or permanently since
          the closure, compared to other businesses like retail, health care,
          auto dealerships and manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Compared to hospitality businesses, only 98 retail businesses have
          shut down temporarily or permanently. This includes clothing stores,
          shoe stores and department stores, among others.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Similarly, 72 health care businesses have been affected with temporary
          or permanent closures. These businesses include hospitals, eye
          doctors, gyms and dentists, among others.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Auto dealerships and manufacturing round out the top 5 most affected
          New York State businesses, with 42 and 36 temporary or permanent
          closures since the pandemic began.
